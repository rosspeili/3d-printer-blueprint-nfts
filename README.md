# 3d-printer-bluprint-nfts
<h1>NFTs as access/authentication tokens for 3d-printing blueprints.</h1>

The project proposes the use of an NFT format to provide access to 3D printer blueprints, where the NFT represents ownership of the blueprint and provides authentication for the user to access and print the item. Specifically, the project suggests that users could buy an NFT representing a specific item, such as a Nike sneaker, and use it to access the 3D printer blueprint for that item. The code files provided is an example of how a Python script could handle the authentication and printing process for a hypothetical 3D printer that uses AMF files as well as a basic NFT contract that could be adjusted based on each case. eg. some NFTs could be expiring, or have limited uses. Eg. 1 NFT = 1 pair of sneakers. The idea explores the potential for NFTs to provide a secure and decentralized means of distributing 3D printer blueprints, while also protecting the intellectual property of the original creators.

<h2>Basic .sol contract format:</h2>

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract SneakerNFT is ERC721 {

    uint256 public totalSneakers;
    mapping (uint256 => string) public sneakerBlueprints;
    mapping (uint256 => bool) public sneakerPrinted;

    constructor() ERC721("SneakerNFT", "SNFT") {}

    function mint(string memory _blueprint) public {
        uint256 tokenId = totalSneakers + 1;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
        sneakerBlueprints[tokenId] = _blueprint;
        sneakerPrinted[tokenId] = false;
        totalSneakers++;
    }

    function printSneaker(uint256 tokenId) public returns (bool) {
        require(_exists(tokenId), "Sneaker does not exist");
        require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not the owner of this Sneaker");

        if (sneakerPrinted[tokenId]) {
            // sneaker already printed
            return false;
        } else {
            // print the sneaker
            // 3D printer instructions go here
            sneakerPrinted[tokenId] = true;
            return true;
        }
    }
}

This contract includes the ability to mint a new NFT that represents a specific sneaker blueprint, as well as a function to print the sneaker. The sneakerBlueprints mapping stores the blueprint data for each NFT token ID, while the sneakerPrinted mapping keeps track of whether a particular sneaker has already been printed.

As for the 3D printer instructions, this would depend on the specific type of printer being used. However, the printSneaker function in the contract would need to communicate with the printer using the appropriate protocol (such as G-code), and provide the printer with the necessary information to create the sneaker based on the blueprint data.

As for authentication, the contract could include additional checks to ensure that only the rightful owner of a particular NFT is able to print the corresponding sneaker. This could involve using off-chain authentication methods such as OAuth or similar, or possibly integrating with blockchain-based identity solutions such as uPort or Civic.

<h2>Basic .py interface for 3d printers (may vary based on printer model):</h2>

import requests

<b>define the endpoint to access the NFT contract</b>
nft_contract_endpoint = "https://example.com/nft-contract"

<b>define the endpoint to access the 3D printer</b>
printer_endpoint = "https://example.com/printer"

<b>define the token ID of the NFT representing the sneaker blueprint</b>
sneaker_token_id = 1234

<b>retrieve the sneaker blueprint from the NFT contract</b>
response = requests.get(nft_contract_endpoint + "/sneaker/" + str(sneaker_token_id))
sneaker_blueprint = response.json()["blueprint"]

<b>authenticate the user</b>
user_authentication = {"username": "user1", "password": "password1"}
response = requests.post(printer_endpoint + "/auth", json=user_authentication)
auth_token = response.json()["auth_token"]

<b>send the sneaker blueprint to the printer for printing</b>
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer " + auth_token}
response = requests.post(printer_endpoint + "/print", json=sneaker_blueprint, headers=headers)

<b>handle the response from the printer</b>
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Sneaker printed successfully")
else:
    print("Error printing sneaker:", response.text)
    
//
    
This code assumes that the 3D printer uses an API to receive and process print jobs, and that authentication is handled using a simple username/password scheme. The code retrieves the sneaker blueprint from the NFT contract, authenticates the user with the printer, and sends the sneaker blueprint to the printer for printing. The code then handles the response from the printer to determine whether the sneaker was printed successfully or not.

Note that this is a very simplified example, and in practice, the code would need to handle many more edge cases, error conditions, and security concerns. Additionally, the code would need to be customized to work with the specific 3D printer and software being used.

<b>The most common 3D printer standards are:</b>

STL (STereoLithography) - This is the most common format used for 3D printing. It represents 3D objects as a series of connected triangles
OBJ (Wavefront Object) - This format is often used for 3D printing because it supports complex geometries, textures, and materials.
AMF (Additive Manufacturing File Format) - This is a newer format that supports more advanced features like color, materials, and textures.

<b>The most common operating systems used for 3D printing are:</b>

Windows - Many 3D printing software applications and drivers are designed to work on Windows operating systems.
MacOS - Macs are becoming increasingly popular for 3D printing, and many software applications and drivers are available for MacOS.
Linux - Linux is a popular operating system for 3D printing enthusiasts and professionals due to its flexibility and open-source nature.

<b>The most common programming languages used for 3D printing are:</b>

Python - Python is a popular language for 3D printing due to its ease of use and large community of developers creating open-source libraries for 3D printing.
C++ - C++ is a powerful and widely used language in the 3D printing industry due to its speed and efficiency.
Java - Java is also commonly used for 3D printing due to its cross-platform capabilities and wide availability of libraries and frameworks.
